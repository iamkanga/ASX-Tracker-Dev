2025-08-12 Session Summary

**Key Issues Addressed/Discussed:**

*   **CORS Errors:** Significant problems with CORS when the backend App Script returns `null` or `N/A` values, causing display issues. This is a major recurring issue that needs a robust solution.
*   **UI & Theming:**
    *   **Resolved:** The blue text for ASX codes has been successfully changed to a coffee color.
    *   **Outstanding:** In the portfolio view, the profit and loss bars at the top have a black fill, which is incorrect. This styling should be governed by the selected theme (e.g., light/dark/coffee).
*   **Dynamic Elements & State:**
    *   **Outstanding:** The watchlist view does not reposition correctly when the ASX code buttons are opened or closed.
    *   **Outstanding:** The dynamic title bar is not updating as expected, an issue carried over from previous sessions.
    *   **Outstanding:** ASX code buttons are not functioning after a hard reload, despite working previously. This points to an initialization or state restoration problem.
    *   **Outstanding:** Notifications require a page refresh to appear after a hard reload, indicating a service worker or initialization timing issue.
*   **Mobile Specific:**
    *   **Outstanding:** A "Try Again" pop-up is incorrectly appearing and blocking the Google authorization sign-in button on mobile devices, even though the sign-in process itself is successful.

**Previous Session Notes (for context):**

2025-08-12
- Header UX: Made whole title clickable, pointer cursor, and green keyboard-only focus ring.
- Sidebar: Initialize closed on desktop after reload.
- Notifications: Restore persisted alert count on DOMContentLoaded and post-auth before live prices load.
- Title sync: Ensure header title updates after restoring lastSelectedView; resolve from userWatchlists if select text missing.
- Minor: Bound click handler to title container for reliable activation area.

Conversation handoff (compact): Dividend calculator UI fix, PWA hygiene, prior UI/behavior changes

Latest issue and fix
- Problem: Dividend calculator "Investment Value" select rendered incorrectly and a stray dot appeared between Franked Yield and Investment Value.
- Root cause: Malformed CSS selectors for calculator fields (missing leading "." on .calc-input-group rules) and no explicit hr styling inside the calculator modal.
- Fixes:
	- style.css: Corrected .calc-input-group input/select selectors (desktop and mobile sections). Added scoped separator: #dividendCalculatorModal hr { border-top: 1px solid var(--border-color); border: 0; margin: 10px 0; }.
	- index.html: Bumped stylesheet reference to style.css?v=0.1.5.
	- service-worker.js: Updated precache list to include ./style.css?v=0.1.5; skipWaiting/clients.claim already in place. Cache name remains share-watchlist-v1.0.8.
- Status: Changes saved and precache updated. Pending verification on devices to confirm normal select rendering and no stray dot. No JS logic changes; calculations unaffected.

Key prior improvements (context)
- UI polish: Version badge placement, company name under code, standardized pure #FF0000/#00FF00 for numbers and borders.
- Watchlist layout and icons refined for desktop/mobile.
- Market closed behavior: Automatic Sydney-time checks with informational banner only (no global ghosting; compact view uses subtle background tint).
- Share Details modal: Restored live price, 52-week high/low, and P/E; unique container to avoid selector conflicts.
- PWA: Versioned assets, updated SW with precache discipline, skipWaiting and clients.claim to reduce stale clients.

Files involved
- index.html: Dividend calculator markup and CSS link now style.css?v=0.1.5.
- style.css: Fixed .calc-input-group selectors; added hr styling scoped to the calculator modal.
- service-worker.js: Precaches ./style.css?v=0.1.5; cache name share-watchlist-v1.0.8 unchanged.
- script.js: Calculator bindings intact; no changes required for this UI bug.

Quality gates (quick)
- Build: N/A (static site).
- Type/Lint: N/A.
- Smoke: Requires runtime check to validate dropdown rendering and separator on both desktop and mobile.

Requirements coverage
- “Fix dividend calculator select rendering and remove stray dot”: Done (CSS selector corrections + modal-scoped hr style).
- “Keep app colors pure red/green; restore modal metrics; auto market-close handling with banner only”: Done previously.
- “Ensure updates reach clients under SW”: Done (asset version bump + SW precache update); may optionally bump cache name if propagation lags.

Next steps
- Verify on-device the calculator modal: confirm proper Investment Value dropdown, no stray dot, and Estimated Annual Dividend updates as selection/inputs change.
- If any clients lag receiving CSS, consider bumping CACHE_NAME to a new version to force a clean install.
