2025-08-13 Session Summary (Enhanced)

1) Conversation Overview
- Primary Objectives
    - Replace legacy target price notifications with a modern, intuitive, professionally styled alert system.
    - Develop in stages: Phase 1 (UI/UX) first, Phase 2 (logic & Firestore) after validation.
    - Fix “Save disabled for new share” and “Duplicate share after save.”
    - Persist alert settings on save using serverTimestamp for createdAt/updatedAt.
    - Read triggered alerts from Firestore, populate Notification Hub, update badge, and support mute/unmute per alert.
- Session Context
    - Phase 1 UI/UX completed; save/duplicate bugs fixed; SW cache bumped.
    - Phase 2: Wrote alerts on save (upsert), added real-time listener for triggered alerts; wired Notification Hub and badge; added mute/unmute.

2) Technical Foundation
- PWA frontend: index.html, style.css, script.js; service worker for caching/versioning.
- Firebase Web SDK v11.6.1: App/Auth/Firestore; serverTimestamp exported on window.firestore.
- Data flow: Prices via Google Apps Script; alerts in Firestore drive Notification Hub.
- Architecture: Snapshot-driven state, dedupe by id, merge writes preserve createdAt.

3) Codebase Status
- index.html
    - Initializes Firebase/Auth/Firestore; exposes helpers and serverTimestamp; onAuthStateChanged wiring.
- service-worker.js
    - CACHE_NAME share-watchlist-v1.0.13; precaches style.css?v=0.1.6; skips dynamic APIs; cleans old caches.
- script.js
    - Helpers: dedupeSharesById.
    - Loading: real-time listeners for shares and cash categories.
    - Live prices: fetchLivePrices updates livePrices and triggers re-renders.
    - Alerts persistence: upsertAlertForShare writes one alerts doc per share with intent/direction/targetPrice/enabled and serverTimestamp for createdAt/updatedAt (merge preserves createdAt).
    - Alerts consumption: loadTriggeredAlertsListener listens for targetHit == true; splits into enabled vs muted; updates badge and modal if open.
    - Controls: toggleAlertEnabled updates enabled and updatedAt; updateTargetHitBanner reflects enabled count; showTargetHitDetailsModal renders Active and Muted sections with Mute/Unmute.
    - Auth lifecycle: starts/stops alerts listener on sign-in/out.

4) Problem Resolution
- Save disabled for new share: Fixed gating by wiring new toggles to save state.
- Duplicate share after save: Removed optimistic local push; dedupe on snapshot and render; bumped SW cache.
- Timestamps: Switched to serverTimestamp for createdAt/updatedAt; merge to preserve createdAt.
- Notification alignment: Badge and Notification Hub now derived from alerts snapshots, not transient price calc.

5) Progress Tracking
- Completed
    - Phase 1 UI/UX and Notification Hub; bug fixes; SW cache bump.
    - Alert persistence (serverTimestamp) and alert-driven UI with mute/unmute.
- Optional / Pending
    - Add CSS treatment for muted alerts (visual distinction).
    - Consider Firestore indexes for future composite queries.
- Validation
    - Syntax checks pass; runtime wiring verified; cache version up-to-date.

6) Active Work State
- App shows real-time triggered alerts; badge reflects enabled alerts; users can mute/unmute alerts in the Notification Hub.
- Muted styling is a low-risk UI enhancement if desired.

7) Recent Operations
- Implemented alerts listener, refactored banner count, added toggleAlertEnabled, and updated modal rendering with Mute/Unmute.
- Confirmed serverTimestamp export in index.html and consumption in script.js.
- Verified service worker cache and stylesheet versioning; performed syntax smoke checks (no errors).

8) Continuation Plan
- If desired, add a subtle style for muted alerts in CSS (e.g., reduced opacity/grayscale) to visually differentiate them.
- Monitor real-time behavior; add Firestore indexes if query patterns evolve.
